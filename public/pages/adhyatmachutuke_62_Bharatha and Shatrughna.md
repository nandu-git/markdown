## The discus and the conch    
  
      
                                                 
  
Vishnu is typically depicted with four hands, each holding an object. The rear left holds the 
conch or shanka, called “Paanchajanya”. The rear right holds the discus, called “Sudarshana”. 
These positions change when the Lord assumes different rupas (forms).  
  
Paanchajanya is said to have emerged during the churning of the ocean, and is considered to 
be the foremost among all musical instruments, the producer of primordial sound.  
  
The Sudarshana Chakra is a celestial weapon, depicted as a whirling discus of fire, 
resplendent as a thousand suns.  
  
An imaginative story describes how the conch and the discus chided Vishnu’s sandals for not 
knowing its place, when he is supposed to have entered Vaikunta along with the sandals, 
after granting moksha to Gajendra. As a result of this the conch and discus had to venerate 
the Lord’s sandals and worship them every day for fourteen years   
  
                                                      Bharatha  
 
Bharatha, the only son of Kaikeyi, was married to Mandavi, the daughter of Kushadhwaja, 
sister of Shruthakirthi, cousin of Sita and Urmila, and niece of Janaka Maharaaja. They had 
two sons, Taksha and Pushkala.   
Bharatha’s strength of character is revealed after the exile of Raama, where he condemns 
Kaikeyi and announces that he will not call her “mother” thereafter and refuses to ascend the 
throne.  
Bharatha goes to the forest and entreats Raama to return to 
Ayodhya. Upon being firmly refused, he concedes to ruling in the 
name of Raama, by placing his sandals on the throne. Carrying the 
sandals on his head, he returns heavy-hearted to Nandigram, on the 
outskirts of Ayodhya, and lives the life of a hermit, for fourteen 
years.  
Some say that he dug a pit and slept in it so as to be lower than 
Raama, who would sleep on the ground.  
Bharatha had also sworn that if Raama were to not return at the end of fourteen years he 
would immolate himself. Raama, wondering if Bharatha had gotten used to being king, sent 
Hanuman to find out. If that were the case, Raama had decided to remain in exile forever. 
When Hanuman came to Ayodhya, he saw Bharatha preparing a pyre at Nandigram, ready to 
enter it. Hanuman hurriedly conveyed the news of Raama’s impending arrival at which 
Bharatha rejoiced. Bharatha carried Raama’s sandals on his head and welcomed him by 
placing his feet in them.  
Bharatha made peace with Kaikeyi, after Raama became king.   
  
               
Goswami Tulasi Das has captured the fraternal love between Raama and Bharatha in the 
Hanuman Chaalisa, where, Raama hugs Hanuman who has flown in with the Sanjeevani and 
revived Lakshmana, by saying, “Tum hum priya Bharatha sama bhai..” You are as dear a 
brother as Bharatha!  
  
                                                Shatrughna   
  
Shatrughna was the incarnation of Vishnu’s chakra.  He was married to Shruthakirthi, sister of 
Mandavi, cousin of Sita and Urmila, and niece of Janaka Maharaaja. They had two sons called, 
Subahu and Shatrughati.  
Shatrughna, the twin of Lakshmana, was exceptionally close to Bharatha. He accompanied 
Bharatha, whenever the latter visited Kekeya, his maternal grandfather’s kingdom. He was 
the only brother who stayed in Ayodhya during the 14 year exile of Raama, running the 
kingdom, handling the administration, looking after the queen-mothers and reporting every 
night to Bharatha.   
  
The episode of him grabbing Manthara by her hair and dragging her offers us a tiny glimpse 
of his fiery temper, befitting his swaroopa.  
In the Raamayana, his act of slaying Lavanaasura, nephew of Raavana and king of 
Madhupura, finds special mention. Lavanaasura was undefeatable as he was in possession of 
Shiva’s trishula or trident. Shatrughna succeeds in his mission, by using an astra (weapon 
presided by a specific deity) invoking Vishnu.  
Raama crowns him the king of Madhupura. Later, Shatrughna divides his kingdom into 
Madhupura and Vidisha, passing them on to his sons, while he joined Raama, along with 
Bharatha, in performing jala-samaadhi (giving up the mortal body in water) by entering the 
river Sarayu.
