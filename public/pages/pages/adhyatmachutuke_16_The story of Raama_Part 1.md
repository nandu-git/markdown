## Baala Kaanda

In the kingdom of Kosala, lived a righteous king

Dasaratha was his name, and his main wives were three

Happy in every way except one, he prayed to the Almighty seeking a son

Guided by Rajguru Vasishta, performed the powerful Putra Kameshti Yaga

The Gods were pleased and gave him paayasa,

He promptly gave it to favourite Kaikeyi and chief queen Kausalya


Poor Sumitra was forgotten, but not by the other two

She received a part of both of theirs, and thus were born two noble heirs

Shatrughna loyal to Kaikeyi’s son, Lakshmana inseparable from Kausalya’s

Kaikeyi gave birth to Bharata, the noble; and Kausalya to Ramachandra



They grew into handsome young lads, loved by everyone in the nearby lands

To help Vishwamitra went young Rama, to the dense forest of Dandaka

Along with Lakshmana, he slayed the man-eating demoness Tataka

Protecting the sages, killing demons, chasing off Maricha

On the way to the palace of Janaka, redeeming Ahalya,

The petrified wife of penitent Rishi Gautama



In Mithila, princes vied with each other at Sitaswayamvara

Pre-ordained the name of the groom, Shri Ramachandra

To string it was every prince’s strength’s token

The bow was effortlessly strung and broken

Sita was to wed victorious Rama

The hands of his other daughters, overjoyed Janaka

Offered Mandavi, Shruthakeethi and Urmila

To princes Bharata, Shatrughna, Lakshmana

## Ayodhya Kaanda

Years passed and all was well, love for Rama made people’s hearts swell

While Bharata and Shatrughna had gone a-visiting

To crown Rama, Dasaratha thought befitting

Kaikeyi’s hand-maiden Manthara, a hunchback

Upon hearing the news, was taken aback


Poisoned she, the mind of noble Kaikeyi

Who decided to extract a promise long given by

Flying into a temper, forcing Dasaratha to tears

Banished Rama to the forest for fourteen years

To be crowned was her unsuspecting Bharata


Like wildfire the news spread, tears flowed like a river

But Rama, the king- in- waiting, did not as much as quiver

Casting off finery, dressing in beads and hide

Promised Kaikeyi that he would abide

Upholding the tradition of the Ikshvaku dynasty

To honour every promise however nasty


## Aranya Kaanda

Off they left for the forest, Sita accompanying Rama

And of course, the inseparable loyal Lakshmana

Followed they were by the people of Ayodhya

Crossed they the mighty Ganga, aided by boatman Guha

The people of Ayodhya were left behind

Beautiful Chitakoot gave them peace of mind!


Unaware they were of the foreboding news

That to them brought Bharata...very distraught

Their father’s death broke them down, pleaded Bharata for Rama’s return

Rama would not break his word, Bharata would not turn homeward

Taking Rama’s sandals, Bharata relented

To rule in Rama’s name till the exile ended


From Chitrakoot to Panchavati, there they met Shoorpanaki

Rebuffed by Rama, jealous of Sita, lost her ears and nose to sharp Lakshmana

Off she went to her brother with ten heads

“Oh Brother! Of what use is a harem full of women

When the most beautiful is wedded to a man?”


Besotted Ravana went to Maricha, his uncle

Conjuring demonic magic came he to the jungle

No ordinary deer this,  made of golden skin

Bewitching the royal princess like an enchanted djinn

Pleaded she to have the deer, Rama said be not fooled, my dear

Persistent was Sita, successful the ruse

Lakshmana followed Rama, the plan did not amuse

Fiery Lakshmana who had his own suspicion

Drew a circle around Sita and laid a restriction

A false sage drew Sita out, the circle thus lost its clout

The mask slipped, true nature revealed

The ten headed demon whom Sita had believed

Grabbed her and flew skyward, to meet a most unlikely defender

Old Jatayu, a bird-friend of Dasaratha, valiantly fought to rescue Sita

Rama met Lakshmana and both immediately knew

All was not well, where Sita was they had no clue
