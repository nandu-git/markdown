# | 1723 | The story of Raama Part 2     |


## Kishkinda Kaanda 

Travelling southward after slaying Kabanda

Reaching the rocky banks of Pampa

An articulate Brahmin in disguise

Met the Lord his most beloved Daasa

Hanuman led them to the Vaanaras in hiding
A historic moment of friendship everlasting


Aggrieved Sugriva swore allegiance

Rama in turn had to wreak vengeance

On his brother upon Sugriva’s behalf,

The wrestling brothers, difficult to tell apart

A garland helped Rama to kill

Vali the valiant, for that was God’s will!

     
## Sundara Kaanda 

The Vaanaras spread in all eight directions

But Hanuman alone had special instructions

Carrying the Lord’s signet ring, news of Sita he was sure to bring


After each monkey and bear had expressed their capacity

Jambavan reminded Hanuman of his immense capability

Meeting Sampaati, stamping Mount Mahendra, flying non-stop to land in Lanka

Defeating Lankini, searching for Sita, came he to Ashoka Vana

Consoling Mother Sita, plundering the garden

Hanuman allowed himself to be led to Raavana


Ravana asked for the identity of the messenger in the court

“Daasoham Kousalendrasya” was Hanuman’s humble retort

Curling his tail and forming a seat, tail afire he couldn’t feel the heat

Setting on fire golden Lanka, flew Ramadhoot back to Kishkinda



## Yuddha Kaanda 

Rama and Lakshmana with their army of monkeys

Reached the shores and wondered how to cross please

Day and night prayed Rama to the ocean king

Angered, finally his bow he began to string

Varuna, fearful, appeared before him

Promised to uphold every rock thrown in

Building the bridge, the army crossed over

After being joined by Vibhishana, Raavana’s brother


Onward they marched, the battle was fierce

Rama, Lakshmana perched next to Hanuman’s ears

When Lakshmana and many Vaanaras fell

What would happen then, who could tell?

But with Hanuman around, can anything be impossible?

Carrying the mighty Sanjeevini like a pebble

Revived Lakshmana, the Vaanaras, and their hope

To escape, Raavana now had no scope


Raavana fell, Rama had won, the battle over

When Sita arrived, a hush did hover

To prove her chastity, Rama felt it dire

That Sita enter Agni, the Lord of Fire

Out came Sita unscathed and pure

Proven beyond doubt everyone was sure


The exile was over, Vibhishana was king

Off they left for Ayodhya in that flying thing

The Pushpaka Vimaana flew northward

Rama had  thus honoured his word

##  Uttara Kaanda 

Exuberant was the reception, joyous the crowd

Every street was lit, on Rama’s head was the crown

He sat on the throne with his beloved wife

And his brothers dearer to him than life

But the one who served him best, was no mere human

The Lord’s greatest devotee, the Wind God - Hanuman

Thus began the reign of Raama Raajya
