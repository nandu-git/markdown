## Harikathaamruthasaara is popularly called Shri Jagannatha Daasaru’s magnum opus.

Jagannatha Daasaru has captured the essence of Shri Madhwaacharya’s “ Sarvamoolagrantha ” and presented it in Kannada for the benefit of the masses.

Jagannatha Daasa had the twin advantage of having been a great Vedic and Vedantic scholar in Sanskrit **and** having experienced inner bliss as a Daasa, composing devotional works in Kannada.

Harikathaamruthasaara has 32 chapters, called “ sandhi”. The 33 rd “phala-sthuthi sandhi” has been composed by Karjigi Daasaru. Scholars speak of Jagannatha Daasa ’s choice of chandassu ( the patterns of rhythm and sound used in poetry), and the play of grammar like use of the number of maatra ( the duration of pronouncing one short syllable ) in one padya (verse), of poornapramathi* (compact, exhaustive wisdom) and so on.

*also used to describe Madhwaacharya for his infinite knowledge

Jagannatha Daasaru has used the metre “ Bhamini shatpadi ” meaning, each verse has six lines. The first and last two lines are short and contain 14 maatras each while the two long lines in the middle have 23 maatras each. The total number of maatras in each verse is thus 102.
